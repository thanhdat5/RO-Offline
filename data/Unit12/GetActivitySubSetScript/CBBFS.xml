        <SCRIPT>Two men from Switzerland, Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg, made a special aircraft called the [{Solar}] Impulse 2. It’s unique because it uses solar energy to fly instead of fuel. The two pilots [{intended}] to fly around the world using only solar power. They wanted to do this to make people think more about [{renewable}] energy. In 2015, the pilots took off in their special aircraft. They planned for a five-month long journey, but [{technical}] problems and poor weather [{conditions}] caused long delays. Both men were still [{determined}] to finish the trip. After 505 days, they [{successfully}] completed their trip.
