        <SCRIPT>Amelia Earhart is known as an American [{pioneer}] for women and in aviation. In 1935, she flew over the Pacific Ocean on her own. She was the first [{female}] to do this. Earhart also wanted to be the first female pilot to fly around the world. She started this [{voyage}] with her [{navigator}], Fred Noonan. They almost finished the trip, but sadly they never [{returned}] home. There was a problem with the airplane, and the weather was too bad to land on a(n) [{island}]. It is likely their plane crashed somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. People [{searched}] for them, but they were never found.</SCRIPT>
