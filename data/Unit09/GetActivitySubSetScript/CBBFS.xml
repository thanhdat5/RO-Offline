        <SCRIPT>A long time ago in the United States, Orville and Wilbur Wright [{received}] a toy helicopter. The boys were very [{interested}] in the helicopter. It gave them ideas about making real flying machines. When the brothers were older they built models of flying machines. In 1903, they built a real flying machine with a(n) [{engine}]. Wilbur tried flying it first, but his flight [{crashed}] after flying for less than four seconds. The brothers [{spent}] two days fixing the plane. When they were [{ready}] to fly again, they flew the plane for twelve seconds. The plane even [{landed}] safely.</SCRIPT>
