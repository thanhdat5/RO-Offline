        <SCRIPT>The Wright brothers were the first people to fly a(n) [{aircraft}] in 1903. A little over twenty years later, airplane technology has [{advanced}] a lot. In 1924, eight U.S. [{Army}] pilots took off in four airplanes from the city of Seattle. Their [{mission}] was to fly around the world. After 175 days, only two of the four [{original}] planes finished the voyage. One crashed and the other had [{mechanical}] problems. The other planes returned home. The first airplane could only fly 260 meters, but twenty years later planes could fly over 44,342 kilometers around the [{globe}].
