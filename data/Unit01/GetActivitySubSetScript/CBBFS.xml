        <SCRIPT>Millions of people travel between Los Angeles and San Francisco every year. These cities are about 650 kilometers [{apart}]. Most people travel between these cities on an airplane, which takes one hour. However, a new kind of train, the Hyperloop could make this trip in 30 minutes. This train would carry [{passengers}] in pods. Pods would use [{magnets}] and low air pressure to [{float}] and move through [{tubes}]. The Hyperloop is the idea of a(n) [{inventor}] named Elon Musk. It would cost [{billions}] of dollars, but it would save people time and money.
